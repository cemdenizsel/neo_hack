# NexNFT

Flow starts when user interacts with our mobile application. User starts chatting with the LLM model inside our application and generates the desired NFT from the GenAI model. Later on with the function call feature of the LLM, LLM calls the function to mint the NFT with the desired name, URL and wallet address. Itâ€™s creating NFTs with just simple chatting.
